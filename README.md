[Link to video of this code working as part of the larger project](https://youtube.com/shorts/lM69gOKh45I?feature=share)

This is the source code for the "Blender and Moving Platform Controller" from my larger "Automated Soylent Maker" project, detailed on my [website here](https://stevenuray.net/automated-soylent-maker/).

Notice: I deliberately did not invest a lot of time in writing Clean Code because I wanted to focus on other aspects of the project. Be advised [Uncle Bob](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin) would not look kindly on the above code.
